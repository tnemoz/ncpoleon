# `RewritingStrategy` is a `#[pyclass]` Rust enum: a plain, non-instantiable class whose variants
# are class attributes. It is *not* an `enum.Enum` subclass, so it has no `name`/`value` and cannot
# be instantiated or iterated. Unlike `Realness` and `Canonicality` it is not declared `eq`/`eq_int`
# either, so its variants only ever compare equal to themselves, never to their `int` discriminant.
# The `None` variant exists at runtime but cannot be spelled as an attribute in Python source; it is
# only reachable through `getattr(RewritingStrategy, "None")`, hence its absence below.

    There is no such class at runtime: each of the four combinations of (non-)commutativity and
    real/complex coefficients is its own `#[pyclass]`, exactly as it is its own monomorphisation on
    the Rust side. This class carries the part of their API that does not depend on which
    combination it is, so that generic code can be written against `Polynomial[MonomialType, Scalar]`
    the way generic Rust code is written against `Polynomial<MonomialType, Scalar>`.

    Everything whose result *does* depend on the combination (arithmetic promoting real coefficients
    to complex ones, comparisons building a constraint of the matching kind) is declared here only
    as widely as is true for all four, and narrowed to a single class by each of them.
