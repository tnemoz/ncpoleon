# Contributing

If you want to contribute to `ncpoleon`, first of all, thanks for considering it! This file will guide you through the steps required to do so.

## Setup

In order to build the library, you will have to have [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/tools/install/) and [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) installed on your system. You will also need the nightly toolchain, along with its `rustfmt` component, since formatting checks run under nightly. You can install both by running

```shell
rustup toolchain install nightly --component rustfmt
```

Once that's done, you can run

```shell
uv sync --dev --all-extras --config-setting 'build-args=--profile=dev'
```

to build the library and install the required dependencies. Note that this will install MOSEK regardless of whether you have a license or not, but it won't be used if no valid license is detected.

MOSEK does not publish a wheel for every platform `ncpoleon` supports, however, and `uv` treats an extra it cannot resolve as an error rather than as something to leave out. On macOS x86_64 and on musl-based Linux, use `--extra picos` in place of `--all-extras`. On Windows arm64, drop the extras entirely: cvxopt has no wheel there either, and its sdist does not build against MSVC, so PICOS is unavailable as well. The tests that need a solver skip themselves when it is missing, so the rest of the suite still runs. The same substitution applies to every `--all-extras` command below.

## Pull request checks

After having made your changes, there are several checks that your code must pass in order to be merged:

 - Clippy should pass using
 ```shell
 cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features
 ```
 - Rustfmt should pass using
 ```shell
 cargo +nightly fmt --check
 ```
 - Ruff should pass using
 ```shell
 ruff check
 ```
 and
 ```shell
 ruff format --check
 ```
 - The Rust-side tests should pass using
 ```shell
 cargo test
 ```
 - The Python-side tests should pass using
 ```shell
 uv run --dev --all-extras --config-setting 'build-args=--profile=dev' pytest
 ```
 - Finally, you can benchmark your code by running
 ```shell
 uv run --dev --all-extras --config-setting 'build-args=--profile=release' pytest --codspeed
 ```
 Specifically, we will test whether your changes introduces a regression in performance before merging.

Remember also to update the documentation and the `.pyi` stub files, and to add tests to cover your changes if applicable.

## Benchmarking locally

`scripts/benchmark_local.py` answers one question: *did my change make `get_relaxation` faster or
slower?* Use it when you have touched something on the hot path and want an answer before pushing.

Running `pytest --codspeed` outside CI will not tell you: it prints `no performance measurement
will be made since it's running in an unknown environment` and just runs the benchmarks.

The script needs nothing beyond the setup above — it is plain wall-clock timing, with no Valgrind
and no CodSpeed instrumentation involved.

### How to use it

The script always measures whatever is currently built, so comparing two versions means building
each in turn. On a machine with nothing else running:

```shell
# 1. Time the same build twice, to see how much this machine wobbles on its own.
#    Your change has to beat that wobble to count as a real result.
uv run scripts/benchmark_local.py --baseline

# 2. Measure the code without your change, in a throwaway worktree checked out at the
#    commit you branched off `main` from.
git worktree add ../ncpoleon-baseline "$(git merge-base HEAD main)"
cd ../ncpoleon-baseline
uv sync --dev --all-extras --config-setting 'build-args=--profile=release'
uv run scripts/benchmark_local.py

# 3. Measure it with your change
cd -
uv sync --dev --all-extras --config-setting 'build-args=--profile=release'
uv run scripts/benchmark_local.py

# 4. Drop the worktree once you are done comparing
git worktree remove ../ncpoleon-baseline
```

Do not use `git stash` for step 2: it leaves untracked files behind, so a new `.rs` or `.py`
file of yours would silently end up in the "baseline" measurement, and `git stash pop` will
happily pop somebody else's stash if you had one before you started. The worktree has none of
your edits, tracked or untracked, and touches neither your working tree nor your stash stack.
It builds into its own `.venv`, so expect step 2 to pay for a full release build.

Compare the `min` columns from steps 2 and 3. **If the difference is smaller than the floor step 1
gave you for that case, you have not measured anything** — the machine moved more than your code
did. When a result matters, repeat steps 2 and 3 once more; load drifts over minutes, and a single
before/after pair quietly blames your change for that drift.

Run every case, which is the default. The whole sweep takes about 40 seconds, and a change that
helps one problem size can easily hurt another: the level 1 and level 2 max-cut cases stress the
moment matrix fill by very different amounts, while `chsh-L11` and `i3322-L4` are non-commutative
and exercise code the max-cut cases never touch. Measuring a single case hides all of that.

Naming one case — `--list` shows them all — is for tightening the feedback loop while you are
actively tuning something, where 40 seconds a round starts to hurt. `max_cut-L2-n25` (~680ms) and
`chsh-L11` (~520ms) are the ones to pick, being the largest commutative and non-commutative cases
respectively. Come back to the full sweep before you conclude anything.

### Reading the output

`--baseline` runs the same build twice, so every difference it reports is noise. It prints a floor
per case rather than one overall number, because the noise is a roughly fixed number of
milliseconds: `max_cut-L2-n25` (~680ms) reproduces to 0.5%, while `max_cut-L1-n5` (~0.1ms) swings
by over 100% and is marked `below resolution`. Ignore anything under about 20ms.

Read the `min` rather than the mean. The noise is additive and one-sided — interference only ever
makes a run slower — so the fastest round is the closest to the truth. The `median` is a useful
second opinion; the mean is not.

### If the numbers look unstable

 - Close anything running in the background.
 - Pin the CPU with `--pin <cpu>`, which uses `taskset`, and on Linux set the governor to
   `performance`; `powersave` leaves frequency scaling live.
 - Each case already runs in its own interpreter, because benchmarks sharing a process contaminate
   each other: `max_cut-L2-n20` measures 220ms alone but 410ms when it follows the smaller cases.

To find out *why* something is slow, profile it instead. `perf record` shows where the time went,
whereas a timer only gives one number per run.

## Continuous integration and the MOSEK license

Some of our checks, namely the MOSEK-backed test suite and the CodSpeed performance benchmarks, need a commercial MOSEK license to run. That license is stored as a repository secret, and for security reasons GitHub does not expose repository secrets to workflows triggered by pull requests coming from a fork. This means these specific checks can't run directly against an external contributor's pull request the way our other checks do.

### Where to open your pull request

All incoming pull requests should be made against the `buffer` branch. Here's what happens when you do so.

1. **Fast checks run immediately, on every PR, from anyone.** Linting, the
   Rust test suite, and the parts of the Python test suite that don't need
   MOSEK all run automatically — no approval required.
2. **MOSEK-backed checks wait for a maintainer's approval.** Because these
   checks require the license secret, a maintainer has to manually approve
   the run once they've reviewed your changes. This isn't a judgment on your
   contribution, but a deliberate step to make sure nothing in a PR can
   exfiltrate or otherwise misuse the license before a human has looked at
   the diff. You may see these checks sit in a "waiting" state for a bit
   until a maintainer gets to it.
3. **Once a maintainer merges your PR into `buffer`, a second pull request
   opens automatically**, from `buffer` into `main`. You don't need to do
   anything for this — it happens on its own. Since `buffer` lives in this
   repository rather than a fork, this second PR gets the full test suite,
   coverage, and the CodSpeed performance comparison, including CodSpeed's
   check that can block the merge if it detects a regression. This is the
   real final gate before your change reaches `main`; a maintainer will
   merge it once everything is green.
4. On every push on `main`, including the merging of the PR originating 
   from `buffer`, `buffer` is force-pushed into the state of `main`. This
   ensures that both branches stay in sync.

We've adopted this framework because the CodSpeed action, which we use to test for performance regression, doesn't support the `pull_request_target` event. As a result, merging your code onto `buffer` means that your code should pass all the checks required to be merged on `main`. The second PR then checks that no performance regression happens when using a valid MOSEK license, in which case it is then merged onto `main`.
